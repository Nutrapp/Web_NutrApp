# Project Guide: WEB_ROTUSCAN

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a web application built with Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. It likely provides a web interface for the ROTUSCAN project, though the exact functionality isn't clear from the file structure alone.

**Key Technologies:**

*   Node.js
*   Express.js
*   EJS
*   Nodemon (for development)

**High-Level Architecture:**

The application follows a typical MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern:

*   **Models:** Likely contain data models and database interactions (located in the `models/` directory).
*   **Views:** Use EJS templates to render the user interface (located in the `views/` directory).
*   **Controllers:** Handle user requests and interact with models and views (located in the `controllers/` directory).
*   **Routes:** Defined in `index.js` to map URLs to controller actions.

## 2. Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**

*   Node.js (version compatible with dependencies)
*   npm (Node Package Manager, usually included with Node.js)

**Installation:**

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2.  Navigate to the project directory: `cd WEB_ROTUSCAN`
3.  Install dependencies: `npm install`

**Basic Usage:**

1.  Start the development server: `npm start` (this uses Nodemon to automatically restart the server on file changes)
2.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:<port>` (the port is likely defined in `index.js` or a configuration file).

**Running Tests:**

The `package.json` file includes a test script, but it's currently configured to display an error message. You'll need to implement actual tests for the project.

## 3. Project Structure

*   `.continue/`: Contains configuration files for the Continue development environment.
*   `config/`: Likely contains configuration files for the application (e.g., database connection settings).
*   `controllers/`: Contains the application's controller logic.
*   `fontes/`:  Likely contains font files used in the project.
*   `models/`: Contains the application's data models.
*   `public/`: Contains static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images.
*   `views/`: Contains EJS templates for rendering the user interface.
*   `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
*   `index.js`: The main entry point of the application, defines routes and starts the server.
*   `LICENSE`: Contains the license information for the project.
*   `package-lock.json`: Records the exact versions of dependencies used in the project.
*   `package.json`: Contains metadata about the project, including dependencies and scripts.
*   `README.md`: Provides a general overview of the project.

**Key Files:**

*   `index.js`:  Defines the main application logic, including routing and server startup.
*   `config/`:  Contains configuration settings for the application.
*   `controllers/*`:  Handle user requests and interact with models and views.
*   `models/*`: Define data models and interact with the database.
*   `views/*`:  EJS templates for rendering the user interface.

## 4. Development Workflow

**Coding Standards:**

*   Follow standard JavaScript coding conventions.
*   Use meaningful variable and function names.
*   Write clear and concise comments.

**Testing Approach:**

*   Implement unit tests for individual components.
*   Implement integration tests to verify interactions between components.

**Build and Deployment Process:**

*   The project can be deployed to a Node.js hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud) or a server with Node.js installed.
*   The deployment process typically involves installing dependencies and starting the application.

**Contribution Guidelines:**

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a branch for your changes.
3.  Implement your changes and write tests.
4.  Submit a pull request.

## 5. Key Concepts

*   **MVC (Model-View-Controller):** The application follows the MVC architectural pattern.
*   **Routing:**  Mapping URLs to specific controller actions.
*   **Middleware:** Functions that execute during the request-response cycle.

## 6. Common Tasks

*   **Adding a new route:**
    1.  Define the route in `index.js`.
    2.  Create a corresponding controller action in the appropriate controller file.
    3.  Implement the logic for the controller action.
    4.  Create a view (EJS template) to render the output.

*   **Creating a new model:**
    1.  Define the model in the `models/` directory.
    2.  Implement the necessary database interactions.
    3.  Use the model in your controllers.

## 7. Troubleshooting

*   **Application crashes:** Check the server logs for error messages.
*   **Incorrect routing:** Verify that the routes are defined correctly in `index.js`.
*   **Database connection errors:** Check the database connection settings in `config/`.
